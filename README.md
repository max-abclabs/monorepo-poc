# Monorepo for Careos Frontend

This is the result of researching what would be a good approach for using vite vue3 and ts in a monorepo for the careos frontend. This is not at all finished but more of a POC (proof of concept).

## Get started

- `npm install`

## Commands

- `npm run start <app-name>` runs the app locally
- `npm run build <app-name>` builds the app
- `npm run gen:app <app-name>` scaffolds and generates a new vue app for the monorepo
- `npm run gen:lib` prompts you for questions to generate a lib in the libs folder
